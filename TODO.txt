content/pipeline:
- continuous update worker from fatcat
- add gzip to intermediate files pipeline commands
- parallelize SIM indexing
- makefile targets for bulk ingest

cleanups:
- better typing/annotation of work pipeline
- test coverage
- use settings.toml for defaults of CLI args

ponder:
- smaller author font size (?)
- "search inside" phrasing
- "counts" target to summarize (to console)

data quality:
- handle sim_issue items with multiple issues in single item (eg, issue="3-4")
