more accessibility:
- try lynx
- lynx filters: "no form action defined"
- lynx filters: duplicated (would be good to de-dupe in general)
- "missing image" alt tag
- "hit count" should not be <h3> (see also lynx)
- fulltext download: <a> alt/title
- all footer headers should be same header class
- should SERP page have an <h1>? "Search Results"? hidden?
- search ARIA pages
- search filter labels not linked correctly?
- orange tag labels: low contrast?
- next/previous grey low-contrast


language notes:
- french would open up canadian partnerships?
- UN languages (there are 6)


- Onion-Location header
- es 7.x library breaks QA searching
    => setup small public QA index somewhere public
- <meta> description
- canonical links?
- "clear filters" link/button
- jinja2: "if xyz is defined" better than "if xyz"
- "default" translation option (clear prefix, use browser default)
- detect browser-requested languages for default language

copy editing:
- "how it works" page
- "Contribute" -> "How To Participate"
- web.archive.org not found -> resolved
- link to "known issues" from alpha warning?
- /alpha page, include known issues there

content/pipeline:
- continuous update worker from fatcat
- add gzip to intermediate files pipeline commands
- parallelize SIM indexing
- makefile targets for bulk ingest

cleanups:
- "web assets" (CSS etc) in this repo or on *.archive.org in general
- better typing/annotation of work pipeline
- test coverage
- use settings.toml for defaults of CLI args

ponder:
- smaller author font size (?)
- "search inside" phrasing
- "counts" target to summarize (to console)

data quality:
- handle sim_issue items with multiple issues in single item (eg, issue="3-4")
