content/pipeline:
- plan for getting release dumps sorted by work ident
- parallelize SIM indexing

cleanups:
- better typing/annotation of work pipeline
- test coverage
- use settings.toml for defaults of CLI args

ponder:
- robots.txt
- some space-holder for missing thumbnails
- smaller author font size (?)
- "search inside" phrasing

data quality:
- handle sim_issue items with multiple issues in single item (eg, issue="3-4")
