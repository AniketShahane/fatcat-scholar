<h3>How It Works</h3>

<p>Content in this search index comes in one of three forms:

<ul>
  <li><b>public web content</b> as preserved in <a href="https://web.archive.org">The Wayback Machine</a> and <a href="https://archive-it.org">Archive-It</a> partner collections
  <li><b>digitized print materials</b> from paper and microform collections
  <li><b>general materials</b> from <a href="https://archive.org">archive.org collections</a>, including collaborations with partners
</ul>

<p>This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PARqfbYIdXQ">2019 FORCE11
conference presentation</a> gives an overview of the technical infrastructure
and goals of the project overall.

<h3>Content Sources</h3>

<p>Metadata comes from <a href="https://fatcat.wiki">fatcat.wiki</a>, an open
user-editable catalog of scholarly work. It should be possible to track and
attribute the provenance of content and metadata in all cases; please contact
us if you have questions or concerns (contact information below).

<h3>Text and Data Mining</h3>

<p>We intend to provide researcher access to the full corpus for text and data
mining purposes. Derived datasets may also be posted publicly for analysis, for
example a citation graph or N-gram frequencies by year. If you are interested
or would like to see specific datasets made available, please contact us.

<p>Currently snapshots of the full fatcat metadata corpus and upstream metadata
sources are uploaded periodically to the
<a href="https://archive.org/details/ia_biblio_metadata">Bulk Bibliographic
Metadata</a> collection on archive.org.
