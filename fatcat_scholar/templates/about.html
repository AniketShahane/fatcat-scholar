<h3>How It Works</h3>

<p>Content in this search index comes from preservation copies at the Internet
Archive in one of three forms:

<ul>
  <li><b>public web content</b> in the Wayback Machine web archives
  (web.archive.org), either identified from historic collecting, crawled
  specifically to ensure long-term access to scholarly materials, or crawled at
  the direction of our Archive-It partners
  <li><b>digitized print material</b> from paper and microform collections
  purchased and scanned by Internet Archive or our partners
  <li><b>general materials</b> on the archive.org collections, including
  content from partner organizations, uploads from the general public, and
  mirrors of other projects
</ul>

and goals of the project overall.

<h3>Content Sources</h3>

<p>Metadata comes from <a href="https://fatcat.wiki">fatcat.wiki</a>, an open
user-editable catalog of scholarly work. It should be possible to track and
attribute the provenance of content and metadata in all cases; please contact
us if you have questions or concenrs.

<h3>Text and Data Mining</h3>

<p>We intend to provide researcher access to the full corpus for text and data
mining purposes. Derived datasets may also be posted publicly for analysis, for
example a citation graph or N-gram frequencies by year. If you are interested
or would like to see specific datasets made available, please contact us.

<p>Currently snapshots of the full fatcat metadata corpus and upstream metadata
sources are uploaded periodically to the
<a href="https://archive.org/details/ia_biblio_metadata">Bulk Bibliographic
Metadata</a> collection on archive.org.
