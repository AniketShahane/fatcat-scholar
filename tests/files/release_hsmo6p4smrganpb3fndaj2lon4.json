We address this need using oaDOI, an open online service that determines OA status for 67 million articles. We use three samples, each of 100,000 articles, to investigate OA in three populations: (1) all journal articles assigned a Crossref DOI, (2) recent journal articles indexed in Web of Science, and (3) articles viewed by users of Unpaywall, an open-source browser extension that lets users find OA articles using oaDOI. We estimate that at least 28% of the scholarly literature is OA (19M in total) and that this proportion is growing, driven particularly by growth in Gold and Hybrid. The most recent year analyzed (2015) also has the highest percentage of OA (45%). Because of this growth, and the fact that readers disproportionately access newer articles, we find that Unpaywall users encounter OA quite frequently: 47% of articles they view are OA. Notably, the most common mechanism for OA is not Gold, Green, or Hybrid OA, but rather an under-discussed category we dub Bronze: articles made free-to-read on the publisher website, without an explicit Open license. We also examine the citation impact of OA articles, corroborating the so-called open-access citation advantage: accounting for age and discipline, OA articles receive 18% more citations than average, an effect driven primarily by Green and Hybrid OA. We encourage further research using the free oaDOI service, as a way to inform OA policy and practice.</jats:p>","mimetype":"application/xml+jats"}],"refs":[{"index":0,"extra":{"authors":["Anderson"]},"key":"10.7717/peerj.4375/ref-1","year":2017,"title":"When the wolf finally arrives: big deal cancelations in North American Libraries"},{"index":1,"extra":{"authors":["Anderson"]},"key":"10.7717/peerj.4375/ref-2","year":2017,"title":"The forbidden forecast: thinking about open access and library subscriptions"},{"index":2,"extra":{"authors":["Antelman"]},"key":"10.7717/peerj.4375/ref-3","year":2017,"title":"Leveraging the growth of open access in library collection decision making"},{"index":3,"extra":{"authors":["Archambault"]},"key":"10.7717/peerj.4375/ref-4","year":2013,"container_name":"Proportion of open access peer-reviewed papers at the European and world levels–2004–2011"},{"index":4,"extra":{"authors":["Archambault"]},"key":"10.7717/peerj.4375/ref-5","year":2014,"container_name":"Proportion of open access papers published in peer-reviewed journals at the European and world levels–1996–2013"},{"index":5,"extra":{"authors":["Archambault"]},"key":"10.7717/peerj.4375/ref-6","year":2016,"title":"Research impact of paywalled versus open access papers"},{"index":6,"extra":{"authors":["Berg"]},"key":"10.7717/peerj.4375/ref-7","year":2010,"title":"Measuring the scientific output and impact of NIGMS grants"},{"index":7,"extra":{"authors":["Björk"],"doi":"10.1016/j.joi.2016.08.002","volume":"10"},"key":"10.7717/peerj.4375/ref-8","year":2016,"container_name":"Journal of Informetrics","title":"Hybrid open access—a longitudinal study","locator":"919"},{"index":8,"extra":{"authors":["Björk"],"doi":"10.1002/leap.1021","volume":"29"},"key":"10.7717/peerj.4375/ref-9","year":2016,"container_name":"Learned Publishing","title":"The open access movement at a crossroad: are the big publishers and academic social media taking over?","locator":"131"},{"index":9,"extra":{"authors":["Björk"],"doi":"10.1002/leap.1096","volume":"30"},"key":"10.7717/peerj.4375/ref-10","year":2017,"container_name":"Learned Publishing","title":"Gold, green, and black open access","locator":"173"},{"index":10,"extra":{"authors":["Björk"],"doi":"10.1002/asi.22963","volume":"65"},"key":"10.7717/peerj.4375/ref-11","year":2014,"container_name":"Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology","title":"Anatomy of green open access","locator":"237"},{"index":11,"extra":{"authors":["Björk"],"doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0011273"},"key":"10.7717/peerj.4375/ref-12","year":2010,"container_name":"PLOS ONE","title":"Open access to the scientific journal literature: situation 2009","locator":"e11273"},{"index":12,"extra":{"authors":["Bohannon"],"doi":"10.1126/science.352.6285.508","issue":"6285","volume":"352"},"key":"10.7717/peerj.4375/ref-13","year":2016,"container_name":"Science","title":"Who's downloading pirated papers?
