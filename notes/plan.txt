- indexing pipeline
    => kafka topics and schemas
- estimate fraction of SIM content with releases in fatcat ("backwards" fraction)

bugs:
. only some thumbnails showing?
    => maybe because found GROBID "before" pdftotext?
. assert 'page_numbers' in issue_meta
- container_original_name (?)

refactors:
- fetch_sim_issue / fetch_sim
- first_page in sim_fulltext object
- container metadata in sim pipeline, and pass through for indexing

- UI tweaks
    => w3c validate

- experiment: existing archive.org fulltext search, my style UI/UX
    => merging server-side is tricky... could do async and show a JS popup?

- small ideas
    => query boost for language match
    => query helper to inject more works
    => 404 and 5xx handlers (web)
    => tags: OA, SIM, "lit review", DOAJ
    => add page_numbers to issue_db
    => title highlighting
    => biorxiv/medrxiv note
        => some "indexing hacks" stage?
    => store snippet of sim_page text to show like an abstract?
    => user guide page with examples
    => example queries on front page?
    => robots.txt?

- later projects/proposals
    => query parser
    => pass query through to in-book reading
    => re-OCR web PDFs with poor/missing OCR
